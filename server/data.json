    "content": "Superconducting quantum processing units (QPUs) are among the most actively developed quantum technologies, with companies like IBM and Google leading the way. These QPUs use superconducting circuits cooled to near absolute zero to enable qubit operations. They benefit from rapid gate speeds and relatively straightforward integration with classical electronics. Recent improvements in coherence times and error rates suggest a promising scaling trend.",
